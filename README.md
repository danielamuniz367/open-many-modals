# open-many-modals
Created with CodeSandbox

The point of this exercise is to create multiple modals that are placed in random positions. 

Closing a modal will close that same modal without affecting other modals. 

Feel free to see how it in action in codesandbox: ([https://codesandbox.io/s/github/danielamuniz367/open-many-modals])
